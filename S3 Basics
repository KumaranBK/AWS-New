S3 Basics — Store Your First File in the Cloud

📦 What is Amazon S3?
S3 stands for Simple Storage Service.

It’s like a giant online locker where you can keep any kind of file — photos, videos, PDFs, backups, app data, etc.

🧠 Think of it as:

“Google Drive, but for developers and companies, and way more powerful.”

🧱 Basic S3 Terms (explained simply):
Term	What It Means (in plain English)
Bucket	A folder that holds your files. You must create a bucket before adding files.
Object	Any file (image, document, video) you upload is called an object.
Key	The name and path of the file inside the bucket.
Region	Where your bucket is stored (choose one close to you).
Storage Class	Tells AWS how often you’ll access the file. Cheaper if rarely accessed.
🛠️ Step-by-Step: Create Your First S3 Bucket
Go to the AWS Console
Sign in at console.aws.amazon.com
Search for “S3” in the top search bar
Click the first result.
Click “Create bucket”
Fill in the details:
Bucket name: Must be globally unique (e.g., my-first-bucket-2025)
Region: Choose your region (e.g., US East (N. Virginia))
Leave everything else as default for now.
Scroll down and click “Create bucket”
🎉 You’ve created your first cloud folder!

📤 Upload Your First File
Click on your bucket name
Click “Upload”
Click “Add files” and choose any file (e.g., a photo or .txt file)
Click “Upload”
Now your file is safely stored in AWS S3!

🔒 What About Security?
By default, your bucket and files are private.
Nobody can access them unless you allow it.
