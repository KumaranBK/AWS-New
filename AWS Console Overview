🌟 Day 3: AWS Console Tour
.

🖥️ What is the AWS Console?
The AWS Management Console is a web-based interface (like a website) where you can manage and use all the AWS services.

Think of it like the dashboard of a car — it shows you what’s happening and lets you control things easily.

🔐 Step 1: Sign in to the Console
Go to: https://aws.amazon.com
Click “Sign In to the Console” (top right)
Log in with your root account or IAM user (if you’ve already created one)
🛑 Don’t have an AWS account? Create one here — use the free tier!

🧭 Step 2: Explore the AWS Console Layout
Once you’re inside, here’s what you’ll see:

1. Search Bar (at the top)
You can search for any service like “EC2”, “S3”, or “Lambda”.
It’s the fastest way to jump into any tool.
2. Service Menu
You’ll see categories like:
Compute (e.g., EC2)
Storage (e.g., S3)
Networking (e.g., VPC)
Security (e.g., IAM)
3. Recently Visited Services
Once you start using AWS, your most-used services show up here for easy access.
4. Account Info (Top-right corner)
Shows your account name, billing info, and region (important for pricing & setup).
🌍 Step 3: Understand AWS Regions
Look at the top-right — you’ll see a dropdown like N. Virginia (us-east-1).

AWS has data centers around the world called regions.
Services and pricing can differ by region.
Always choose the closest region to your users (for speed).
🧠 Tip: Some services (like IAM) are global, but others (like EC2, S3) are region-specific.

🔁 Step 4: Practice Using the Console
Try clicking and exploring (don’t worry, no charges for just looking around):

What to Click	What You’ll See
EC2	Launch instances (virtual servers)
S3	Create a bucket (storage)
IAM	View users and permissions
VPC	Your private network setup
RDS	Databases you can launch
🧪 Tip: Don’t launch anything yet — just click to explore!
