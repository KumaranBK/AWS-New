✅ What is AWS?
AWS stands for Amazon Web Services.
It’s a big collection of online tools that help people and companies run websites, apps, and store data — without needing to buy their own computers.

Imagine you want to start a website or app.
Instead of buying a big computer (called a server), setting it up, and taking care of it…
You just “rent” those computers from AWS over the internet. Simple, right?

🧠 Real-Life Example:
Think of AWS like electricity or water.
You don’t build your own power plant at home.
You just use electricity when you need it and pay for what you use.

AWS works the same way — you use computing power, storage, or tools when you need them and pay only for what you use.

🔍 What Can You Do with AWS?
You can:

Run websites
Build mobile apps
Store and share files
Create games
Analyze data
Use AI tools (like chatbots!)
All without needing your own physical computer or server.

🌍 How Big is AWS?
AWS is used by millions of people and big companies like Netflix, NASA, and BMW.
It has data centers all around the world so it can work fast, no matter where you live.
