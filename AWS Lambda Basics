AWS Lambda Basics – Run Code Without Managing Servers

⚙️ 1. What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service.
This means you can run your code without creating or managing servers.

➡️ You upload your code to AWS, and AWS takes care of the rest — running, scaling, and stopping it.

🔹 2. How Does Lambda Work?
Here’s the basic idea:

You write some code (Python, Node.js, Java, etc.)
Upload it as a Lambda function
Set a trigger (like a file upload or API request)
AWS runs your code automatically when needed
You’re only charged for the time it runs
🧾 No need to think about servers, memory, CPU, or scaling — AWS handles it all!

📘 3. Key Terms Simplified:
Term	What It Means for You
Lambda Function	Your uploaded code + settings in AWS
Trigger	What causes your code to run (e.g. file upload, API call, timer)
Runtime	The language you write code in (Python, Node.js, etc.)
Event	The input or action that starts the function
Timeout	Max time your function is allowed to run (default is 3 sec)
💡 4. Why Use Lambda?
✅ No server setup
✅ You only pay when your code runs
✅ Scales automatically — handles 1 or 1 million requests
✅ Connects with many AWS services
✅ Perfect for quick automation, APIs, and event handling
⚡ 5. Common Lambda Triggers
Trigger Type	Example Use Case
S3	Auto-resize an image when uploaded to S3
API Gateway	Run code when an API is called
CloudWatch	Run code on a daily schedule (cron jobs)
DynamoDB	React when data changes in the table
SNS/SQS	Run code when a message is received
🧩 6. Beginner Example:
Goal: Say hello when someone uploads a file to S3.

Create a Lambda function in Python
Trigger: When file uploaded to a bucket
Code prints: “Hello, file received!”
🔧 AWS takes care of everything — you just focus on the logic.

🚀 7. Try It Yourself (Free Tier):
Go to AWS Console → Lambda
Click Create function → “Author from scratch”
Choose Python or Node.js
Paste this simple code: def lambda_handler(event, context): return {“statusCode”: 200, “body”: “Hello from Lambda”}
Click Test to see your function in action!
⚠️ 8. Key Limits to Know
Max runtime: 15 minutes
Memory: 128MB to 10GB
Free tier: 1 million requests per month
Keep your code small and fast
For big apps, use Lambda Layers to manage dependencies
