IAM Basics — Control Who Can Do What in AWS

👥 What is IAM?
IAM stands for Identity and Access Management.

It helps you securely control who can access your AWS resources — like S3 buckets, EC2 instances, and more.

🧠 Think of IAM as:

“A security gatekeeper that decides who can enter, and what they’re allowed to do.”

✅ Why is IAM Important?
Keeps your account safe from misuse
Lets you create different users for your team
Allows you to limit access (e.g., one user can only view S3, another can launch EC2)
📖 IAM Basic Concepts (Made Simple)
Term	What It Means
User	A person or application that logs in
Group	A collection of users with shared permissions
Role	A temporary identity for apps/services
Policy	A set of rules that define what is allowed or denied
Permissions	What a user can or can’t do in AWS
Root User	The main admin — never use it for daily tasks!
🛠️ Step-by-Step: Create an IAM User
Go to AWS Console → Search for IAM → Open it
In the left menu, click “Users” → Click “Add users”
Choose:
Username: (e.g., developer1)
Check ✅ “Access key – Programmatic access” (optional)
Check ✅ “Password – AWS Management Console access”
Set a password (temporary is fine)
On the Permissions screen:
Choose “Attach existing policies directly”
Search for AdministratorAccess (just for demo) and select it
Click “Next” → “Create user”
🎉 You now have a new AWS user!

🔑 Sign in as the New User
IAM will give you a login link like:
https://1234567890.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
Open it and log in using the new user’s credentials
Now you’re using AWS without the root account — much safer!

🔏 Policies (Very Simply)
A policy is a document that says:

“This user/group/role can or cannot do these things.”

Example:

Allow user to read S3
Deny user from deleting EC2
Policies are written in JSON (don’t worry — we’ll simplify that later).
