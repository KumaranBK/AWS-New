AWS Global Infrastructure – How AWS Works Around the World

🌍 1. What is AWS Global Infrastructure?
AWS is not just in one place. It’s a global network of data centers. These centers store your apps, websites, and services so users anywhere can access them quickly and reliably.

📍 2. Key Terms You Must Know
🔸 Region
A Region is a geographical area like:

US East (North Virginia)
Europe (London)
Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
➡️ Each region has multiple data centers inside it.

Think of a region as a city where AWS has a big office.

🔸 Availability Zone (AZ)
An Availability Zone is a physical data center inside a region.

Each region has 2 or more AZs
AZs are far enough to avoid disasters, but close enough to work together
Services like EC2 or RDS can run across multiple AZs for high availability
Think of AZs as separate buildings inside that city (region).

🔸 Edge Location
Edge Locations are used by Amazon CloudFront (CDN) to deliver content faster.

Placed in more locations than regions
Helps users access videos, images, or websites with less delay
Think of edge locations as delivery centers close to the user’s home.

🔁 How They Work Together:
✅ You deploy in a Region
✅ Your data lives in 2+ Availability Zones (for safety)
✅ Users access content via Edge Locations (for speed)

💡 Real-Life Analogy:
AWS Term	Real-World Example
Region	City (e.g., Mumbai)
Availability Zone	Buildings in the city
Edge Location	Local delivery center near customers
🔐 Why Is This Important?
Reliability: If one AZ fails, the other can take over
Speed: Edge locations serve content faster
Scalability: You can deploy apps close to your customers
Compliance: You can store data in specific countries (as per laws)
