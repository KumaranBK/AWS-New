✅ What are “Core AWS Services”?
Core services are like the main building blocks of AWS.
Just like you need bricks, cement, and wood to build a house,
You need services like EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, and VPC to build anything on AWS.

Don’t worry — we’ll keep it super simple.

🧱 1. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
🖥️ Think of EC2 as a virtual computer you can rent from AWS.

You can use it to run apps or websites.
It’s just like your laptop — but in the cloud.
You can choose how powerful it is (like picking RAM and CPU).
Example: Want to host a game server or a website? EC2 can run it.

📦 2. S3 (Simple Storage Service)
💾 Think of S3 as your cloud hard drive.

You can store files like images, videos, or documents.
It’s safe, reliable, and can hold huge amounts of data.
Many apps and websites use S3 to store things in the background.
Example: Storing user profile pictures or backups.

🔐 3. IAM (Identity and Access Management)
🧑‍💻 IAM helps you control who can do what in your AWS account.

You can create users and give them permissions.
You can allow someone to access only S3 but not EC2.
Keeps your AWS account secure and organized.
Example: Your developer can access servers, but your intern only sees billing info.

🌐 4. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
🛡️ VPC is like your own private network in the cloud.

It’s a secure place where your AWS resources live.
You control how they connect to each other and the internet.
Keeps your systems safe and isolated.
Example: A private area where your database stays hidden from the internet.

🗄️ 5. RDS (Relational Database Service)
🗃️ RDS is a managed database service.

It lets you use databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.
AWS handles the setup, backups, and updates.
You just focus on using the data — not maintaining it.
Example: An app that saves user data in a database.
