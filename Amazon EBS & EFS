Amazon EBS & EFS – Learn AWS Storage Basics

?
📦 1. What is Amazon EBS?
EBS = Elastic Block Store
Think of EBS like the hard drive of a virtual computer (your EC2 instance).

🔹 Key Points:
Attached to EC2 like a C: drive in Windows
Stores operating system, software, and data
Can be backed up using Snapshots
You can increase the size anytime
If you stop the EC2, the EBS volume is still there
💡 Example:
If your EC2 instance is a laptop, then EBS is the internal hard drive where Windows and files are saved.

🗂 2. What is Amazon EFS?
EFS = Elastic File System
Think of EFS like a shared folder that many EC2 instances can access together.

🔹 Key Points:
Works like a network drive
Multiple EC2 instances can connect to the same EFS
Data stored grows automatically (no size limit)
Useful for shared access (websites, apps needing file access)
💡 Example:
You have 3 EC2 servers running a website. They all need to read and write files to the same folder — EFS helps you do that.

🔁 3. EBS vs EFS vs S3 – What’s the Difference?
